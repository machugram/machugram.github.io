# Copilot Instructions for machugram.github.io

## Project Overview
This is a personal website/portfolio built with [your tech stack, e.g., React, Next.js, etc.].
The site showcases my projects, skills, and professional experience.

## Code Style Preferences
- Follow a functional programming approach where possible
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features (ES6+)
- Prefer arrow functions over traditional function declarations
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components

## Technology Stack
- [List your primary technologies: React, Next.js, etc.]
- [List styling approach: CSS Modules, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.]
- [List any important libraries]

## Project Structure
- `/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/pages`: Page components and routing
- `/styles`: Global styles and themes
- `/public`: Static assets like images and fonts
- `/utils`: Helper functions and utilities

## Best Practices to Follow
1. Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
2. Separate business logic from UI components
3. Use proper semantic HTML elements
4. Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
5. Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG)
6. Write meaningful test cases

## Things to Avoid
1. Using deprecated APIs or functions
2. Complex nested ternary operators
3. Direct DOM manipulation when React alternatives exist
4. Inline styles (except when necessary)
5. Excessive comments for self-explanatory code

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize image loading with proper formats and sizes
- Minimize re-renders in React components
- Use code splitting for larger bundles
- Implement proper caching strategies
