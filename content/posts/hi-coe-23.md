I am going to try and say hi to all my class mates.
If you have been in a class with a size of > 100 (~170), you will know why this is difficult.

Apparently, there are classmates that I have not held a conversation with at all or in about a year.
Why is this an issue?!


People,hear me out!  I am in class with these guys at least 6 times a week! for 4 years! I find it weird.

It's obvious not everyone is going to talk to you all the time but I am trying to keep a list and say 'Hi' to all of them before end of year.

Log: It's 5th March 2023 and i did it. I said 'Hi' to everyone. 

I tried to extend it to my hostel but knocking on everyone's door is tiring.
