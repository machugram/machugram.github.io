Here I am seated behind my desk, reminiscing when I was happy.          
   
This is me in my final semester with the mounting pressure of graduating with good grades and a sustainable job in a dying economy in the western side of Africa.       

I have a stack of coins amounting to 6 cedis on the side of my laptop.      

I have Spotify open listening to rappers bragging about their wealth on repeat.     

Contemplating to use this stack of coins to pay for internet bundle to cover the rest of the week or to buy a chilled can of juice as my throat itches for something cool even though I wish I could afford something that could get me tipsy.
