Ghana, located in West Africa, has a rich and diverse history that dates back to ancient times. The area now known as Ghana was once home to several powerful kingdoms and empires, including the Ghana Empire, which flourished from the 6th to the 13th century. This empire was known for its wealth, particularly in gold, which attracted traders from across the Sahara Desert.
